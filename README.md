Codes and demo data are listed in folder 'mantle melting_crystallization2023'. Please download all the files.
Codes here are used to calculated certain element concentrations in the liquid and olivine during mantle melting and crystallization with given mantle compositions and melting-crystallization conditions.

# Files Introduction
In the folder 'mantle melting_crystallization2023', there seven '.py' files and one '.csv' file. The '.csv' file named 'olivine_glass_data.csv' provides users with natural data for Hawaiian olivines and MORB olivines, Hawaiian basalts, and MORB glasses, which can be used to compared to the modeled crystallization results. After running code 'melting_cystallization2023.py', six figures will be plotted automatically. Olivine data are given by Sobolev, A. V. et al. The amount of recycled crust in sources of mantle-derived melts. science 316, 412-417 (2007). MORB glasses data are given by Jenner, F.E. and O'Neill, H.S.C., 2012. Analysis of 60 elements in 616 ocean floor basaltic glasses. Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, 13(2); Yang, S., Humayun, M. and Salters, V.J., 2018. Elemental systematics in MORB glasses from the Mid‚ÄêAtlantic Ridge. Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, 19(11), pp.4236-4259; Yang, A.Y., Langmuir, C.H., Cai, Y., Michael, P., Goldstein, S.L. and Chen, Z., 2021. A subduction influence on ocean ridge basalts outside the Pacific subduction shield. Nature communications, 12(1), p.4757. Hawaiian basalts data are compiled from Georoc (references listed in the .csv file).
